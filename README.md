This Repository Holds Code for A Medium Clone / Blogging Website that I have created as a part of my learning MERN Stack Journey.

This project was a chance to solidify my understanding of a powerful stack:
Frontend: React (with TypeScript for strong typing)
Backend: Hono/Cloudflare Workers (serverless magic)
Database: PostgreSQL (relational powerhouse)
ORM: Prisma with Connection Pooling (smooth database interactions)
Validation: Zod (ensuring data integrity)
Authentication: JWT (secure user access)


While I had a foundational knowledge of these technologies, building this blog truly solidified my grasp.
Each challenge I faced – API handling, component communication, and user authentication – became a learning opportunity. 
I dove into research, experimented with solutions, and ultimately, strengthened my MERN skillset.
Beyond the blog itself, I even published a package to npm! 
This was a great way to learn about version control, package management, and contributing to the open-source community.
